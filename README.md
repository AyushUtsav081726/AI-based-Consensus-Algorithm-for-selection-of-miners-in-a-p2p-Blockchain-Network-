## POAI(Proof of Artificial Intelligence)/AI Based Consensus Algorithm for selection of miners in a p2p Blockchain Network

#### Blockchain is an ingenious technology impacting different industries and was first known through the application Bitcoin. Bitcoin is nothing but a form of currency called crypto currency, which can be used for trading digitally. So, the success behind crypto currency is due to blockchain. In a nutshell, blockchain can be realized as a storage structure that holds records of transactions while ensuring security, transparency,  and decentralization.
#### Though there are many traditional consensus algorithms, like proof of work (POW) and proof of stake (POS),. But all these algorithms have some flaws, like being computationally expensive and monopoly-promoting. So, there is a need to explore new domains of technology to solve the above-mentioned demerits, like blockchain and artificial intelligence. A consensus algorithm based on such new technology could solve the demerit tradational consensus algorithm as well as maintain the efficiency of prediction of miners. It is to be evaluated whether PoAI (Proof of Artificial Intelligence) has the potential to be a good consensus algorithm or not.
